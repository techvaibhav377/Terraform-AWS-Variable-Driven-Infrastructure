# Terraform-AWS-Variable-Driven-Infrastructure

Author: **Vaibhav Gautam**

## üöÄ Project Overview

This Terraform project aims to provision resources in AWS using Terraform variables to drive infrastructure configuration. It automates the creation of a VPC, subnets (public and private), instances, security groups, and key pairs on AWS. By leveraging Terraform's variable-driven approach, the infrastructure setup becomes highly flexible and customizable.

## üìÇ Files Overview

1. **provider.tf**: Configures the AWS provider with the specified region and access keys.
2. **variable.tf**: Declares variables used throughout the project, including AWS access keys, instance configurations, VPC CIDR blocks, subnet CIDR blocks, and more.
3. **multi-instance-deploye.tf**: Defines Terraform resources for launching instances in both public and private subnets.
4. **vpc-public-pvt-subnet.tf**: Defines resources for creating a VPC, public and private subnets, internet gateway, NAT gateway, route tables, and associations.
5. **security-group.tf**: Defines an AWS security group allowing inbound SSH traffic from any IP address and all ICMP traffic, and allowing all outbound traffic.
6. **key-pair.tf**: Defines an AWS key pair to be used for SSH access to the instances.
7. **output.tf**: Defines output values, including VPC ID and subnet IDs for later reference.

## ‚úÖ Tasks Completed

- **AWS Provider Configuration**: Configured AWS provider with access keys and specified region.
- **Variable Declaration**: Declared variables for AWS access keys, instance configurations, VPC CIDR blocks, subnet CIDR blocks, etc.
- **VPC and Subnet Creation**: Created a VPC with public and private subnets, each with specified CIDR blocks.
- **Internet and NAT Gateway Setup**: Configured internet and NAT gateways for public and private subnet internet access.
- **Route Table Configuration**: Created route tables and associated subnets with appropriate routes.
- **Instance Launching**: Launched instances in both public and private subnets, specifying instance types, AMIs, key pairs, and security groups.
- **Security Group Definition**: Defined a security group allowing inbound SSH and ICMP traffic and all outbound traffic.
- **Key Pair Creation**: Created an AWS key pair for SSH access to instances.
- **Output Definition**: Defined output values, including VPC ID and subnet IDs for reference. (Disabled in this repo but you can enable it by removing ext. .dis)
